### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description
In this project, I used **Python** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also, I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used

.gitignore
